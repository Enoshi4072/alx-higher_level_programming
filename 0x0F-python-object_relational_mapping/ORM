Object relational mapers - Is a code lib that automates the transefer of data stored ina relational database tables into objs that are more commonly used in application code
Why are ORMs useful?
- Allows a dev tw rite python code instead of SQL CODE. Devs can use the lang that they are comfortable with instead of writing SQL statements or stored procedures.
- This enables one to speed up the dev of a web application.
- It makes it theoreticaaly possible to switch an application btn var databases

Does one have to use ORM for his web dev?
- Python ORM libs are not required for accessing relational databases.
- Low level access can be provided by another lib called a database connector such as psycopg or MySQL-python for mysql

Downsides of using an ORM?
1. Impedance mistmatch
2. Potential for reduced performance
3. Shifting cimplexity from the database to the application code

Impedance mismatch
- Is a catch all term used for the difficulties that occur when moving data btn relational tables and app objs
- The gist is the means that a dev uses obj is diff from how data is stored and joined in a relational database

Potential for reduced performance
- Performance hit comed from the translation of application code into a corresponding SQL statement which may not be tuned properly

Shifting complexity from the database into the app code
- The code working with an app data has to live somewhere.
- With an ORM, the data manipulation code lives within the apps Python codebase
- The problem comes where it increases the total amount of python code instead of plitting the code btn the app and the databas stored procedures

Python ORM implementations
1. Django ORM
- Comes with its own built in object relational mapping module.
2. SQL alchemy
- Gets the abstraction level "just right" and seems to make comple database queries easier to write than the Django ORM in most cases.
3. Peewee ORM
- Is a python ORM that is written to be simpler, smaller and more hackable
4. Pony
- Is another python ORM available as open source
5. SQL Object ORM
